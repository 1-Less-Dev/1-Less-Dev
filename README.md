Hi, I'm `1 Less Dev`

# My Reason : For the love of a Dog !

 ### A way to give my ( `family` "My favorite creature, My Dog" ) a better life.

# My Goals : Project Outlines
```
    These are some things I wish I had the time to complete.
```

#### Stream Live
  -   A middleware server to allow a user to collect info about their favorite streamers and watch them live, while streaming to a tv, chatting on a mobile device and a family could have every member watching a different stream merged on one tv and all listening to different streams and maybe even handling speech to text.
#### Say What
  -   A Streamers tool to provide individual voices for chat messages, identify conversations by the sound of the voices.
#### Service Pro
  -   I have started creating a multi-node peer-to-peer server that serves webpages to clients and distributes searches to peers and can be performed on either side of the connection and provide the desired results, once each party has received their desired payment or reward. A work while you sleep business cultivator. Intrusion aware and tamper resistant.
#### 100+1
  -   1000+ little things that irritate me and others, for the silly choice's application developers have done, and maybe find solutions, patches or fixes needed to solve or replace these anoyances.
#### Cmdr
  -   A command prompt replacement that handles signals properly and can be resized and provide syntax highlighting and handle things like urls and be backwards compatible with older systems. could also handle command completion and history.
#### Scriptfu
  -   An IDE/Fix to better handle multi-language documents and provide in memory testing and compiling for those Dev's with awesome systems.
#### Simple Bootloader
  -   Standalone Pre-OS environment for any os. Can be run from a USB and used to support any system, ( Backup/Recover/Restore/Install/Patch/Deploy ) any OS with or without networking.
#### Simple PBE Support
  -   Auto ( Patch/Install/Upgrade/Backup )
#### Simple PBE Network
  -   Remote ( Patch/Install/Upgrade/Backup )
#### Net Helper
  -   An application with a purpose build engine to query Web-Only devices like DSL modems and routers and generate a GUI for the user to ( save/update/restore ) its configuration, and with a small footprint, no electron/browser.
#### Scripts
  -   A collection of scripts that have made many tasks simple. Good for learning and automation.
#### Automation Toolbox
  -   Scripts and tools to automate online tasks and allow the user to string them together and spend less time doing these tasks.
#### .LAB
  -   A toolkit to turn any CLI into a ncurces style UI to aid in preparing and running commands.
#### BatchCheck / ScriptCheck
  -   A re-imagining of the famous `shellcheck` but for .bat file or other scripting frameworks, this will include a lexer and a parser.
#### NU-IX
  -   A new version of PE wrapper to unix style commands in windows, done the right way, no emulation layer, import subprocesses code as modules and proper credential management.
#### Net-SW ( Service Worker )
  -   A long time project that I've been trying to make work. Fix the bad habits of Chrome and VSCode of using the application as a server model and offloading millions of CPU clock cycles onto the hosts computer. This is meant to separate the server features into a standalone engine and recompile java on the fly into C structures and give the user the ability to separate the demand into a more responsive GUI for any task and improve network responsiveness and lessen load on systems. " Moto: Don't offload the cloud requirements onto me."
#### Addons+
  -   A library to fix the compatibility issue with addons and extensions for the browser.



# More about my life

```
If you have read on this far, I must commend you and say thank already before you grow tired of my waffling.
This is my scream into the void , to see if I can turn my life around and maybe see some value in my journey in life.
As I said, my reason is my dog. He is the only true thing I have left. And no that is not a euphemism.
I have lost everything I have worked for, even the tech gadgets I collected and cherished throughout my life.
My story starts with me supporting my family's business while I was still a child and looking out for 'their' needs.
I ran my own tech business for many years and supported the die-hard clients even when I had to close the doors.
I worked it the family business for the last 12 years and did what was needed to keep it growing.
SO! , this is where the story becomes a cautionary tail. My whole life I knew my mother was different and now I know how.
It has become evident to me that she is a sociopath and lacks compassion, and she had a lifetime to perfect her skills as a master manipulator.
Due to the epidemic that affected us all, COVID19, I like many of you made some or a lot of choice to try hold thing together for my family.
But they took everything I owned and all the money I had, even my home, including the money I had invested in the family business, and decided to eject me from the business.
And over the last three years, depriving me of my thing, the ability to spend money and make choices on the thing that I needed, even an answer to when I could expect to be paid back for my investment, to be able to live a normal life.
There were no answers.
The family business is now gone because she was unable to keep it all together without someone looking over her shoulder and fixing the problems before they became serious.
Her reality is even so twisted that she thinks it is a normal thing to deprive me of food, even makes excuses to not have to feed the dog in the last three months, our dog has been without food for 3 days and I have now, as of the 4th of Jul, been without food for 97 days, surviving on coffee, tea, warm water and sugar.
So, I hope my knowledge and experiences in life can prove to be of value or even meaning.
My only reason for continuing to fight is to provide for my dog.
If I could help anyone while I am able to, I will.

I am starting a Twitch channel to provide new users or people looking for help a place to get real live tech support and give them the experience to fix their computers by their own input and a little bit of instruction.
I have some ideas to provide a little bit of hackery to maybe build a live stream remote support toolkit.
I have a lifetime of seeing and working with the most expensive tools in support and recovery and also how to get it done without any tools what so ever.
I would also like to make some tutorials and videos for other platforms like YouTube to open the eyes of kids and people looking to get into programing to show them what can be done, only the things native to your OS.

THANK FOR READING !!!
